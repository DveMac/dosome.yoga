You''ll discover that radiating light and love for one hour in a yoga class each week isn''t enough, and that it''s your moral responsibility to shine constantly...just like the sun.  You''ll discover how to naturally flow from your inner light. You''ll discover that being yourself is the best way to shine your inner light upon the world.\n\nRepeating the mantra \"I don''t need permission to shine\" after each pose will reinforce the message. \n\nRaised Arms: (\"I don''t need permission to shine.\")\nForward Bend: (\"I don''t need permission to shine.\")\nLunge: (\"I don''t need permission to shine.\")\nPlank: (\"I don''t need permission to shine.\")\nSalute With 8 Points: (\"I don''t need permission to shine.\")\nCobra: (\"I don''t need permission to shine.\")\nDown Dog: (\"I don''t need permission to shine.\")\nLunge: (I don''t need permission to shine)\nForward Bend: (I don''t need permission to shine)\nRaised Arms: (I don''t need permission to shine)\nMountain: (I don''t need permission to shine)\n\nThe richest place on Planet Earth is not a bank vault filled with gold.

You''ll discover the biggest mistake we humans make is to think that we need someone''s approval to feel good. You''ll discover that radiating light and love for one hour in a yoga class each week isn''t enough, and that it''s your moral responsibility to shine constantly...just like the sun.  You''ll discover how to naturally flow from your inner light. You''ll discover that being yourself is the best way to shine your inner light upon the world.\n\nRepeating the mantra \"I don''t need permission to shine\" after each pose will reinforce the message. \n\nRaised Arms: (\"I don''t need permission to shine.\")\nForward Bend: (\"I don''t need permission to shine.\")\nLunge: (\"I don''t need permission to shine.\")\nPlank: (\"I don''t need permission to shine.\")\nSalute With 8 Points: (\"I don''t need permission to shine.\")\nCobra: (\"I don''t need permission to shine.\")\nDown Dog: (\"I don''t need permission to shine.\")\nLunge: (I don''t need permission to shine)\nForward Bend: (I don''t need permission to shine)\nRaised Arms: (I don''t need permission to shine)\nMountain: (I don''t need permission to shine)\n\nThe richest place on Planet Earth is not a bank vault filled with gold. It''s our graveyards, because they are filled with people that didn''t give themselves permission to shine. They took their talents, gifts and brilliance to their grave in unexpressed potential. The greatest human tragedy is a life half lived, so go forth and shine.\n\n=================\nYoga Lesson Planner \n=================\n\nTo create yoga lesson plans using Drag & Drop technology, take a quick peak at The Yoga Lesson Planner available within The Yoga Teacher Lesson Plan Kit at: http://georgewatts.org"},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en-GB"}', '{"duration":"PT34M10S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":false,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"}', '{"viewCount":"1751","likeCount":"19","dislikeCount":"1","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"0"}', '''5'':9A ''creat'':1A ''georgewatts.org'':11A ''lesson'':5A ''minut'':10A ''plan'':6A ''theme'':3A ''yoga'':4A', '2020-07-02 06:13:48.352879', '2020-07-02 06:13:48.352879');

Yoga had its humble beginning over 5000 years ago. Since the first asana, yogis favored natural yoga mats to support their bodies during the postures. In the beginning, this was as simple as using the natural earth. From there, yogis moved their practice onto rugs made of kusha grass, native to India. More affluent yogis practiced on a deerskin rug, and the most bold practiced on a rug made of tiger skin.\n\nFact #2. Since the early days of yoga mats, many different styles have emerged. The global spread of yoga practitioners created an evolution in yoga mats. In the west, it was originally most common to see yogis spread out on beach towels or cotton mats designed for yoga. Over time, rubber pads were introduced below the cotton mats to prevent slipping. Eventually, the entire mat was made of rubber or various PVC products.\n\nFact #3. Physically, the yoga mat provides many benefits. First and foremost it provides traction. Various poses, such as downward-facing dog, can require a lot of traction. If someone intends to do these poses on the flat wooden floor of many studios, they will be met with a slippery, unsafe surface. A yoga mat provides the necessary traction. This ensures that your focus can be on the pose itself.\n\nFact #4. An unmentioned benefit of a yoga mat is sweat collection. Most mats are made of non-porous materials. They don''t collect sweat as much as they simply allow it a place to sit. Many yoga mats are also made extra thick. This provides padding to delicate bodies on hard surfaces. These mats make it easy to do yoga anywhere, indoors or outdoors. In the winter months, this padding also means that yoga mats provide insulation and warmth for the body.\n\nFact #5. Yoga provides benefits to the body''s all around fitness levels.

Yoga had its humble beginning over 5000 years ago. Since the first asana, yogis favored natural yoga mats to support their bodies during the postures. In the beginning, this was as simple as using the natural earth. From there, yogis moved their practice onto rugs made of kusha grass, native to India. More affluent yogis practiced on a deerskin rug, and the most bold practiced on a rug made of tiger skin.\n\nFact #2. Since the early days of yoga mats, many different styles have emerged. The global spread of yoga practitioners created an evolution in yoga mats. In the west, it was originally most common to see yogis spread out on beach towels or cotton mats designed for yoga. Over time, rubber pads were introduced below the cotton mats to prevent slipping. Eventually, the entire mat was made of rubber or various PVC products.\n\nFact #3. Physically, the yoga mat provides many benefits. First and foremost it provides traction. Various poses, such as downward-facing dog, can require a lot of traction. If someone intends to do these poses on the flat wooden floor of many studios, they will be met with a slippery, unsafe surface. A yoga mat provides the necessary traction. This ensures that your focus can be on the pose itself.\n\nFact #4. An unmentioned benefit of a yoga mat is sweat collection. Most mats are made of non-porous materials. They don''t collect sweat as much as they simply allow it a place to sit. Many yoga mats are also made extra thick. This provides padding to delicate bodies on hard surfaces. These mats make it easy to do yoga anywhere, indoors or outdoors. In the winter months, this padding also means that yoga mats provide insulation and warmth for the body.\n\nFact #5. Yoga provides benefits to the body''s all around fitness levels. A cumulative review indicated that in both healthy and diseased populations, yoga may be as effective as basic exercises at improving a variety of health indicators. Yoga also keeps the practitioner mentally and emotionally balanced. It improves the mood and modulates the body''s stress response, too."},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"}', '{"duration":"PT2M50S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":true,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"}', '{"viewCount":"3478","likeCount":"22","dislikeCount":"6","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"0"}', '''5'':3A ''fact'':5A ''fast'':4A ''mat'':2A ''yoga'':1A', '2020-07-02 06:13:48.352879', '2020-07-02 06:13:48.352879');

The system is very easy to use. There are about 20 short videos in total, they are all named \"Vikasa Yoga Level I - *module name*\". Each video can be downloaded. After downloading, you can arrange the videos in a playlist. Modules can be combined in any order, so regardless of how you rearrange them, they will always flow as a continuous practice. You can start by practicing few modules a day, building up to more complete practice that will take 60+ minutes. The advantage of this system is that you do not need to follow the same routine every day. You do not need to be a yoga teacher to create various routines, just use the modules as building blocks, and you will not go wrong. Vikasa Yoga Level I focuses on basic physical fitness and strengthening of the spine and major joints of the body. Enjoy this basic yoga system and share with friends and family.\n\nAnother note, the music in the background can be used for counting your breath. When you practice, count 4-5 beats as you inhale, and 4-5 beats as you exhale... try to become aware of your breathing pattern, and lengthen/deepen your breath.

The system is very easy to use. There are about 20 short videos in total, they are all named \"Vikasa Yoga Level I - *module name*\". Each video can be downloaded. After downloading, you can arrange the videos in a playlist. Modules can be combined in any order, so regardless of how you rearrange them, they will always flow as a continuous practice. You can start by practicing few modules a day, building up to more complete practice that will take 60+ minutes. The advantage of this system is that you do not need to follow the same routine every day. You do not need to be a yoga teacher to create various routines, just use the modules as building blocks, and you will not go wrong. Vikasa Yoga Level I focuses on basic physical fitness and strengthening of the spine and major joints of the body. Enjoy this basic yoga system and share with friends and family.\n\nAnother note, the music in the background can be used for counting your breath. When you practice, count 4-5 beats as you inhale, and 4-5 beats as you exhale... try to become aware of your breathing pattern, and lengthen/deepen your breath. This concentration and control of breath will make it a real yoga practice, instead of just fitness.\n\nHope you enjoy this. Once you build up the necessary strength, you can follow my complete sequence videos, which are recorded during the teacher training practice sessions.

This feelings yoga book for toddlers and preschoolers includes a list of kids yoga poses and a parent-teacher guide. Ages 2+.\n\nAs a father and as a kid''s yoga teacher, I think this book is simply awesome. It''s a wonderful voyage that invites the kids to travel around the world, to learn about several animals, and also it introduces some different emotions by addressing simple feelings. The text is simple, which is very useful when you are reading stories to kids from 2 to 5 years old, but it can be easily expanded. The yoga poses correspond with pictures, and as they are in a good order, it helps a lot with the class flow. Also, you can encourage the children to make animal noises, making the class much more fun and also letting the kids spend more time on the poses. In addition, the feelings listed in the book can give you an excellent opportunity to work with the kids the expression of their own feelings. Finally, the parent-teacher guide is a wonderful tool ify ou are a parent and you want to introduce yoga to your children, or if you´re a kids yoga teacher, it can simply be a source or a reminder of how to teach yoga to children in a properly and funny way. - Martin\n\nThe Grateful Giraffe is a wonderful literacy prompt to encourage even the youngest children to communicate about their feelings. It''s beautifully illustrated, and the corresponding pictures of the yoga poses are great visuals to support the mind-body connection. The text is simple, but provides the perfect starting point for both adults and children to be creative in deciding how to integrate music or props to extend the story and the yoga poses. The parent-teacher guide at the end is also a helpful tool for those who don''t necessarily have a background in yoga or teaching. The Grateful Giraffe is another great resource by Giselle at Kids Yoga Stories to add to your collection! - Vicki\n\nThe Grateful Giraffe is a wonderful book for you and your child. The beautiful illustrations and easy-to-follow yoga poses are a great way to help your child learn and understand different emotions. The yoga sequence is appropriate for children still developing skills and is even more fun when you incorporate the sound effects from the story. The story also includes tips for flowing between theposes and advice for parents or teachers as they guide children on the journey to understand emotions. - Sarah\n\nThe Grateful Giraffe: A Feelings Yoga Book for Toddlers\nby Giselle Shardlow\nKids Yoga Stories\nISBN: 978-1-943648-18-4\nAges 2 to 5\nBuy on the Kids Yoga Stories website: https://www.kidsyogastories.com/product/grateful-giraffe-english/\nBuy on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Grateful-Giraffe-Kids-Yoga-Feelings/dp/1943648182/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1508246567&sr=8-1&keywords=grateful+giraffe","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-IVL7TmRK0w/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-IVL7TmRK0w/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-IVL7TmRK0w/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-IVL7TmRK0w/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-IVL7TmRK0w/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"KidsYogaStories","tags":["feelings yoga","yoga books","yoga books for kids","kids yoga stories","yoga poses for toddlers","toddler yoga","kids yoga","yoga in schools","yoga for children","yoga stories","emotions yoga"],"categoryId":"27","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"The Grateful Giraffe - A Kids Yoga Stories Audio Feelings Yoga Book for Kids","description":"Express your feelings through yoga poses for toddlers!\n\nAvailable here: https://www.kidsyogastories.com/product/grateful-giraffe-english/\n\nJoin our six yoga kids from around the world as they learn about various animals and relate their behaviors to our feelings.

Iyengar Yoga Sequence","description":"18 Days of Yoga - DAY 7. Iyengar Yoga Sequence\n\nFollowing the success of our 30 Days of Yoga, 13 Days of Yoga and 19 Days of Yoga series, this year we have taken a slightly different approach for our 18 Days of Yoga. Days 1, 7 and 13, are longer sequences where we have done voiceovers, rather than talking to camera. Lin, in the white top, will be showing the classic versions of poses and Leo, in the dark top, will be showing modified versions of the poses using props. The modified versions are for those who find the pose difficult, or who wish to improve their work in the pose. In the subsequent days, we teach three of the poses which are in the previous sequences in more detail. 18th January 2019 will be the fifth annual National Iyengar Yoga Day in the UK and Ireland to celebrate the teachings of Guruji, B.K.S. Iyengar, and to promote Iyengar yoga nationally. Events will include free taster classes and celebrations of his life in Iyengar Yoga Institutes and centres throughout the country. ''Yoga with Lin and Leo'' channel is leading up to this day with a series of sequences. In the Iyengar tradition, these sequences would be regarded as Beginners Yoga poses as they are all taken from the Introductory syllabus, however, they are not suitable for those who are completely new to yoga. If you want Beginners Iyengar Yoga, check out our playlist for an introductory Iyengar yoga course for complete beginners http://bit.ly/2HkKL1J\n\nDay 7 of 18 Days of Yoga - the yoga class comprises the following yoga poses:\nTadasana (Mountain Pose)\nTrikonasana (Triangle Pose)\nUtthita Parsvakonasana (Extended WIde Angle Pose)\nParsvottanasana (Intense Side Stretch - Pyramid Pose)\n\nUttanasana (Standing Forward Bend)\nPadangusthasana (Hand to Big Toe Pose)\nSupta Baddha Konasana (Supine Bound Angle Pose)\n\nJanu Sirsasana (Head to Knee Pose)\nArdha Matsyandrasana (Half Lord of the Fishes Pose)\n\nProne Tadasana (Mountain Pose on front)\nSalabhasana (Locust Pose)\nMakarasana (Crocodile Pose)\n\nGomukasana in Virasana (Cow Face Pose in Hero Pose)\nAdho Mukha Svanasana, (Dog Head Down)\nAdho mukha Virasana\nHalasana (Plough Pose or Plow Pose)\nBent Leg Savasana (Corpse Pose)\n\n\n\n\nIf you are doing the classical yoga poses, you just need your mat, a platform made from 4 pads and a launch pad. If you are doing the modified versions,  you will need the following yoga equipment:\n1 x yoga bolster (you can use 2 x foam pads or a couple of cushions)\n2 x yoga bricks (you can use 2 x foam pads or the seat of a chair)\n1 x yoga belt (you can use cord, rope or even a tea towel)\n5 x Foam pads (you can use folded blankets for your platform with a cushion or similar for the launch pad)\n\nThese sequences aim to improve your extension, alignment and balance in the poses. If you find any of the poses difficult, look at the tutorials which will be released on subsequent days or you can look the poses up in our Yoga Pose Directory, which we are adding to all the time.These tutorials will teach the poses in more detail and sometimes with extra props.\n\n If you are near to Maidstone, in the South East of England, register with the Maidstone Iyengar Yoga Centre and enjoy one of our free classes with us. \nhttp://www.iyengar-yoga.co.uk/\n\nIf you want to try Yoga with Lin and Leo''s  19 Days of Yoga series, check out our Playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/2kf1Vou\nOr our 13 Days of yoga: \nhttp://bit.ly/2oYRTdc\n\nYoga practice can improve strength and flexibility and yoga for back pain relief and yoga for weight loss has been supported by many studies.\n\nJoin Yoga with Lin and Leo for safe, detailed instruction from experienced Iyengar yoga teachers. Although we would always suggest that you find a certified Iyengar yoga teacher so that you can attend a class near you, this channel has yoga sequences to help you practice your yoga at home.\n\nYoga is not a sport but regular practice of yoga sequences can improve fitness levels. Practiced correctly, yoga will stretch muscles and strengthen joints, as well as helping with mental and physical wellbeing.\n\n\n\nFor our ebook, \"Yoga for the Stiffer Body\": https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yoga-Stiffer-Body-Inspirational-Accessible-ebook/dp/B01IYO67M8\nOr our latest ebook, \"Yoga for the Stressed Body.\" https://amzn.to/2XWp7q6\n\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/craddock1310\n\nFor Iyengar yoga classes in the UK: https://iyengaryoga.org.uk/\n\n \n Yoga is not just to increase your flexibility, strength and the general tone of your body; it has the capacity to increase mindfulness, improve your wellbeing and increase your mental resilience.

Tea was purchased and I was not given any incentive to feature it here."}}', '{"duration":"PT6M42S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":false,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"}', '{"viewCount":"136","likeCount":"5","dislikeCount":"0","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"0"}', '''28'':6A ''leav'':9A ''morn'':1A ''prenat'':2A ''tea'':5A,8A ''tweed'':11A ''week'':7A ''yoga'':3A', '2020-07-02 06:13:48.352879', '2020-07-02 06:13:48.352879');

Our posture becomes better, our back pains significantly get better (as there is more support for the spine and the extra pressure is removed), our blood circulation improves, the digestive organs are stimulated and I can go on about the benefits. I sincerely believe it is important to dedicate time to strengthen the body whenever we can in order to live a healthier and happier life! For this reason, I have decided to create yoga for fitness classes. I encourage you to focus on your breath throughout the entire practice and flow with your breath. This will make it easier for you to get into each pose and keep a mind and body connection.

I truly believe that Yoga is for every-body. Yoga has taught me to breathe & to bend. Yes, I was doing these things before, but I would also break down, blow up & occasionally just plain freak out. I still have those moments - thanks to my yoga practice, they just happen a lot less. This practice benefits your whole being - your body, mind, spirit & heart, but you have to practice.

Cover this support with a sticky mat. The platform dimensions need to be app:\n\n24\" (60cm) w x 16\" (40cm) l x 2\" (5cm) h\n\n In addition to your platform, if you are doing the classical yoga poses, you will just need your mat. If you are doing the modified versions, as well as your mat and platform you will need the following yoga equipment:\n1 x yoga bolster (you can use 2 x foam pads or a couple of cushions)\n2 x yoga bricks (you can use 2 x foam pads or the seat of a chair)\n1 x chair\n\n\nFollowing the success of our 30 Days of Yoga and 13 Days of Yoga series, this year we have taken a slightly different approach. We have done voiceovers, rather than talking to camera. Lin, in the white top, will be showing the classic versions of poses and Leo, in the dark top, will be showing modified versions of the poses using props. The modified versions are for those who find the pose difficult, or who wish to improve their work in the pose. 19th January 2018 will be the fourth annual National Iyengar Yoga Day in the UK and Ireland to celebrate the teachings of Guruji, B.K.S. Iyengar, and to promote Iyengar yoga nationally. Events will include free taster classes and celebrations of his life in Iyengar Yoga Institutes and centres throughout the country. ''Yoga with Lin and Leo'' channel is leading up to this day with a series of 19 yoga sequences. \n\nIn the Iyengar tradition, these sequences would be regarded as \"Beginners Yoga\" as all the asanas are taken from the Introductory syllabus, however, they are not suitable for those who are completely new to yoga. We will be doing a series in the New Year which will be a Foundations of Yoga series to introduce those who have never practiced yoga to the subject and which will help to prepare new yoga students for yoga classes or yoga workshops at their local Iyengar Yoga centre and help them practice between classes when they want to do yoga at home..\n\n\nThese sequences aim to improve your extension, alignment and balance in the poses. If you find any of the poses difficult, you can look the poses up in our Yoga Pose Directory, which we are adding to all the time. In the Pose Directory you will find yoga tutorials on many of the poses you will encounter in the 19 Days of Yoga Series. These tutorials will teach the poses in more detail and sometimes with extra props.\n\n If you are near to Maidstone, in the South East of England, register with the Maidstone Iyengar Yoga Centre and enjoy one of our free classes with us. \nhttp://www.iyengar-yoga.co.uk/\n\nIf you want to try Yoga with Lin and Leo''s 30 Days of Yoga series, check out our Playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/2ykAyPY\nOr our 13 Days of yoga: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP0ZtUZ7txI&list=PLLTwDvdKnrC402WmB-SdWrgZWOgp74S4x\n\nYoga practice can improve strength and flexibility and yoga for back pain relief and yoga for weight loss has been supported by many studies.\n\nJoin Yoga with Lin and Leo for safe, detailed instruction from experienced Iyengar yoga teachers.

I absolutely love hip openers, because working on them really helps me to find a comfortable seat. But that doesn''t make them easy.\n\nAll of these stretches are suitable for beginners, but maybe your approach of them will look different, because you are at a different stage. That is perfectly fine!\n\nPlease avoid comparing your practice to mine, as the purpose of the video is simply to demonstrate the stretches, so if you are unable to go that far (yet! with practice your hips will open up as well), please don''t get discouraged.\n\nGo with baby steps, practice on a regular basis and you''ll see your hip openers will pay off! You''ll feel more comfort throughout the day and essentially you will be able to go deeper into each stretch. \n\nBut remember what I always say: building long muscles with stretches takes time, the same way as building big muscles as a weight lifter! You know that just because you did one workout in the gym you will not transform your body.\n\nMake sure you do these stretches regularly, especially if you are aiming to really improve your hip openers. That being said, make sure you also rest adequately. Find the perfect balance, if you worked hard one day and feel soar, make sure you take some time off the next day so you can recover. And get back to the practice when you feel like it, preferably in the next couple of days.\n\nBut most importantly allow your practice to be fun and challenging in an enjoyable way. It should not become a burden. \n\nThere are many muscles involved in opening your hips, so be very careful and always stop I you feel any pain in the knees! That is essential. \n\nI hope you enjoyed these stretches, please let me know how you got on with them!\n\n🥰 Thank you for sharing your practice with me today. 🥰\n\nTake very good care of yourself and I shall see you in the next class!\n\nVeronika\n\n✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼\n\nTUSCANY Yoga Retreat with Karuna Yoga\n\nDates: \n• 21st-28th September, 2020\n• 1st-8th October, 2020\n\nDetails of retreat: www.kraunayogauk.com\n\n➩ Book your place now with  30% non-refundable but transferrable deposit. \n➩ Flexible payment plans are available, just message me on karuna.yoga.uk@gmail.com \n\n✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼・✼\n\nFOLLOW ME ON:\n\n📸 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/karuna.yoga.uk\n\nCHECK OUT MY WEBSITE:\n\n🌍 Website: https://www.karunayogauk.com\n\nGIVE A LIKE AND FOLLOW ON:\n\n👤 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/karuna.yoga.uk\n\nGIVE SOME SUPPORT ON:\n\n💰 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/karunayogauk","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/73bIbcNUzck/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/73bIbcNUzck/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/73bIbcNUzck/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/73bIbcNUzck/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/73bIbcNUzck/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Karuna Yoga","tags":["hipopeneryoga","yogahipopener","hipopener","yogahipopenerclass","yogahipopenervideo","yogastretcheshipopener","yogaclasshipopener","yogabeginnershipopener","yogavideohipopener","karunayogaukhipopenerclass","yogahipopenerexercises","exerciseshipopeneryoga","yogaexerciseshipopener","hipopeneryogaonline","onlineyogahipopener","hipopeneryogamoves","hipopeneryogaposes","yogaposeshipopener","yogahipopenerpose","hipopenerstretches","5stretcheshipopener","quickhipopeneryoga","beginnerhipopeneryoga"],"categoryId":"26","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Yoga to Open your Hips | 20 minute Hip Opener Yoga Class","description":"Hello Beautiful Souls,\n\nToday I have a quick video for you that is packed with super useful stretches to open your hips.

You may find that you’re able to fall asleep more easily and sleep more deeply when you have a consistent yoga practice. Ideally, you should sleep between six and nine hours each night.\n\nQuality sleep is often associated with weight loss. A 2018 study found that people who had restricted sleep five times per week lost less fat than the group that followed their normal sleeping patterns. Both groups were limiting the number of calories they consumed, suggesting that sleep loss has an adverse effect on body composition, including fat loss.\n\nYoga nidra is a form of guided relaxation that you do lying down. The practice may help you to sleep more deeply and increase mindfulness. You can also set intentions during yoga nidra, which may help you to develop weight loss goals.\n\nA small 2018 study found that healthcare workers who did yoga nidra for eight weeks increased their levels of mindfulness. This mindfulness included acting with awareness and not judging inner experiences.\n\nTheir levels of sleepiness weren’t significantly different at the follow-up. However, this score improved the longer people did the practice. Larger, more in-depth studies are needed to expand on these findings.\n\n\nYoga and calorie burning\nWhile yoga isn’t traditionally considered an aerobic exercise, there are certain types of yoga that are more physical than others.\n\nActive, intense styles of yoga help you burn the most calories. This may help prevent weight gain. Ashtanga, vinyasa, and power yoga are examples of more physical types of yoga.\n\nVinyasa and power yoga are usually offered at hot yoga studios. These types of yoga keep you moving almost constantly, which helps you to burn calories.\n\nPracticing yoga may also help you develop muscle tone and improve your metabolism.\n\nWhile restorative yoga isn’t an especially physical type of yoga, it still helps in weight loss. One study found that restorative yoga was effective in helping overweight women to lose weight, including abdominal fat.\n\nThese findings are especially promising for people whose body weight may make more vigorous forms of yoga difficult.\n\nA review of studies from 2013 found that yoga is a promising way to help with behavioral change, weight loss, and maintenance by burning calories, heightening mindfulness, and reducing stress. These factors may help you to reduce food intake and become aware of the effects of overeating.\n\nMore in-depth, high-quality studies are needed to expand on these findings.\n\nHow often should you do yoga to lose weight?\nPractice yoga as often as possible in order to lose weight. You can do a more active, intense practice at least three to five times per week for at least one hour.\n\nOn the other days, balance out your practice with a more relaxing, gentle class. Hatha, yin, and restorative yoga classes are great options.\n\nIf you’re a beginner, start slowly and gradually build up your practice. This allows you to build up your strength and flexibility and prevent injuries. If you don’t have time for a full class on certain days, do a self-practice for at least 20 minutes. Allow yourself one full day of rest each week.\n\nCombine your yoga practice with activities such as walking, cycling, or swimming for added cardiovascular benefits.\n\nAs part of your routine, avoid weighing yourself directly after a yoga class, especially if it’s a hot yoga class, since you may lose water weight during the class. Instead, weigh yourself at the same time each day.\n\nPoses to do at home\nHere are a few yoga poses you can do at home if you don’t have time for a full session.\n\nSun Salutations\nDo at least 10 Sun Salutations. You can increase the intensity by holding some of the positions for longer periods or by speeding up the pace.\n\n\nFrom standing, inhale as your lift your arms overhead.\nExhale as you swan dive down into a Forward Bend.\nJump, step, or walk your feet back into Plank pose.\nHold this position for at least five breaths.\nDrop your knees down and lower your body to the floor.\nExtend your legs, turn the tops of your feet to the mat, and place your hands under your shoulders.\nInhale to lift partway, halfway, or all the way up into Cobra pose.\nExhale to lower back down and then push up into Downward Facing Dog.\nHold this pose for at least five breaths.\nExhale as you jump, step, or walk your feet to the top of the mat and stand in a Forward Bend.\nThen inhale to lift up your arms overhead.\nExhale to lower your arms back down by your body.\nBoat pose\nThis pose engages your whole body, especially your core, and helps to reduce stress.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vFfmL26jpC0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vFfmL26jpC0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vFfmL26jpC0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vFfmL26jpC0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vFfmL26jpC0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jai Yoga Academy","tags":["power yoga","weight lose","lose","weight","power","yoga","flow weight lose","master Ajay","yoga power","lose weight in 10 mins","20 minutes weight lose","28 days fat lose"],"categoryId":"27","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Power yoga flow weight lose  with Master Ajay in Jai yoga","description":"Practicing yoga can help improve the quality of your sleep.

If you''re experiencing lower back tension due to sitting at a desk for a long time, driving, or maybe even from menstruation cramps, these yoga poses will help you to soothe lower back muscles in just 10-minutes.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the activities that we do these days lead to tension in the lower back. Whether it''s sitting for too long at a desk, standing too much, being overactive, or not being active enough! The lower back needs your love and yoga is a great way to give it the care it needs to soothe current pain and even to avoid future lower back pain.\n\nIf you experience regular lower back tension, make yoga your new best friend! A lot of lower back tension comes from the muscles in the body becoming tight from inactivity. This compresses the lower back which results in pain and reduced mobility over time. Through this 10-minute yoga practice, we can lengthen the muscles again and decompress the lower back. We''ll also do some gentle spinal twists to increase spinal mobility and flexibility.\n\n🔔 SUBSCRIBE to the channel for free yoga videos every week and to support free yoga + HIT  👍 if you enjoyed this video. \n\n😊 Please SHARE with a friend.\n\n🧘🏻‍♂️ YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY: \n\n▶️  10-MINUTE HIP STRETCH: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmGMzeiT2Jw&t=20s\n▶️  10-MINUTE SHOULDER STRETCH: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5pDHI44-lY&t=21s\n▶️ Yoga for Better Posture: https://youtu.be/_wIZjT_uBM4\n▶️ Yoga for the Back and Spine: https://youtu.be/VwjxA3GRjSA\n▶️ Deep Back Stretch: https://youtu.be/pZmu8Wusu3A\n\n🗒️  This PLAYLIST has more 10 Minute Yoga Videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9mB1a-zyhI_kDKMpMbGrpUird16J9K0U\n\n💌 LET''S CONNECT: \n▪ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/katiemcgrat...\n▪ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/katiemcgrath...\n\n🎶Music: Places, by Bloome \nhttps://bit.ly/3dCIjkW\n\n----------------------------------------\nKatie McGrath Yoga recommends that you consult your physician regarding the applicability of any recommendations and follow all safety instructions before beginning any exercise program.

Today we will set the intention to have being at ease in our bodies be more important that getting something done. We will allow ourselves to be deeply and totally absorbed in the sensation of what is happening in our bodies. We will let go of comparison and thinking about how other people see us. There is no rush here or struggle to achieve anything. The bottom line is you are feeling the yoga posture in your body, you are doing it.\n\nToday’s yoga class is designed for the absolute beginner. You can do this class if you have never done a yoga class before in your life. I will give you slow, easy to follow, step-by-step instructions and tell you exactly how to get in and out of each and every pose. Detailed instructions will be given for even the most basic poses and how to breathe. You will be given lots of cues of how to pay attention to your body and where to feel the effects of the yoga poses. You do not have to be athletic, flexible, strong, balanced, skinny or coordinated to do this class. The slow, step-by-step instructions will give you the confidence to let go of your self-judgment and stay focused with commitment and motivation.\n\nSign up for my 31 day beginner yoga challenge: http://www.melissawest.com/31-day-beginner-yoga-challenge/ \n\nRelated Videos: Yoga for Beginners: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0343C65F2EEFE37E\n\nPlease Subscribe Here: http://bit.ly/RMV4hC\n\nHere''s my Website: http://www.melissawest.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/yournamasteyoga\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/drmelissa\nFollow me on Instagram: http://instagram.com/drmelissawest#\nFollow me on Pinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/drmelissawest/\nFollow me on Google+: https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DrMelissaWest/posts\n\nJoin our Membership Site:\nhttp://www.melissawest.com/membership/membership-sign-up/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HOzoRKjVl9s/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HOzoRKjVl9s/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HOzoRKjVl9s/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HOzoRKjVl9s/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HOzoRKjVl9s/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Melissa West","tags":["beginner yoga","novice yoga","yoga for beginners","easy yoga","step by step yoga","beginner yoga poses","step by step instructions","easy to follow instructions","slow yoga","modifications","Dr Melissa West","yoga classes","beginning yoga","yoga beginners","yoga classes for beginners","gentle yoga","yoga exercises for beginners","beginning yoga poses","beginner yoga routine","yoga routine for beginners","beginner yoga sequence"],"categoryId":"26","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Yoga for Beginners | Beginner Yoga Easy to Follow 1 hour | Yoga with Dr. Melissa West 272","description":"http://www.melissawest.com/272/\nFor show notes click on the link above\n\nThis is an easy to follow beginner yoga class.

day, I often do more throughout my day but if I tried to motivate thinking about how I have to do loads of exercise everyday for the next 6 months to even make a dent it would be far too easy to lose

present in the here and now to myself in the future.\n\nMy goal is to regenerate the muscular support of my spine  bringing it back to life and correcting the herniated discs in my lower lumbar region

Somewhere between childhood and adulthood, we stopped playing. When we carve out some leisure time, we’re more likely to zone out in front of the TV or computer than engage in fun, rejuvenating play like we did as children. But play is not just essential for kids; it can be an important source of relaxation and stimulation for adults as well.\n\nWhile play is crucial for a child’s development, it is also beneficial for people of all ages. Play can add joy to life, relieve stress, supercharge learning, and connect you to others and the world around you. Play can also make work more productive and pleasurable.\n\nPlay is fun and can trigger the release of endorphins, the body’s natural feel-good chemicals. Keep you feeling young and energetic. In the words of George Bernard Shaw, “We don’t stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.” Play can boost your energy and vitality and even improve your resistance to disease, helping you function at your best.\n\nAlong with Restorative, Yin is the most accessible of the physical yoga systems, in that it can be practiced by anyone, regardless of age or ability. It doesn’t even require a mat – a carpet or blanket will do just fine. In Yin, you hold deep, floor-based postures in stillness for between three and 20 minutes. Using very little muscular effort, each student is encouraged to find their own individual ‘edge’ – the point of stress, but before pain – to the posture, as it is here at this precipice that we enable our bodies to begin to safely open.\n\nThe gentle traction created in Yin works not on the muscles and blood (our ‘Yang’ tissues) but on our connective ‘Yin’ tissues – tendons, ligaments, cartilage, fascia, and bone. When we talk about flexibility – particularly in yoga – the focus tends to be on the muscles: “Lengthen your hamstrings, feel the stretch across your abdomen…” and so on. However, as Yin yoga and anatomy expert Bernie Clark explains, we hold only 41% of our bodily tension in our muscles. The remaining 57% is held in our connective tissues and joints (with a further 2% in our skin).\n\nYoga and breathing aids in relieving depression and anxiety. Steady breath stimulates our PNS which is our at response system responsible for digestion and healing. Our sympathetic nervous system is like Wario and our parasympathetic nervous system is like Mario. \n\nGet to know yoga from the comfort of home and a taste of what a class would be like. Or, if you''re too busy to commit a full hour then this is the morning routine for you. \n\nEach week will offer a new half-hour yoga flow to follow along from home that offers full body stretches and warm-up. Won''t make you dripping with sweat but will heat your body and focus your mind. \n\nInstructor: Joy Scola from the YouTube channel, Psychetruth.\n\nI wasn''t born \"bendy\". When I first started my health journey, I couldn''t touch my toes and backbends HURT! They gave me headaches and made me feel cranky. Since I thought backbends were the worst, I decided to make it a focus in my practice. So grunting and while silently cursing in my mind, I stretched. Now, I love backbends! \n\nI still find that if I don''t practice for a while, I get stiff in my body and remember why I started yoga in the first place. Some days you may not feel very up to it. Listen to and be gentle with your body when this arises. Go easy and move with your breath while we gently wake up the body and mind. Moving oxygen into the bloodstream to feel more refreshed, centered, and focused. \n\nYoga Tip: If you struggle with committing to a workout/Yoga practice, try telling yourself, just 5/10 mins and I’m done. It takes a great weight off the ego and clears resistance which allows room for small changes and small changes lead to big growth.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AAMwYew5GNo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AAMwYew5GNo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AAMwYew5GNo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AAMwYew5GNo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AAMwYew5GNo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Joy Scola","categoryId":"26","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Hatha High 30 min Guided  Shoulder & Hip Opener Yoga Class","description":"Find relief for tight shoulders and hips and help to open up the spine in this 30 min Hatha High guides Yoga Class\n\nhttp://www.joyscola.com\nhttp://www.instagram.com/joyscola\nhttp://www.facebook.com/joyscola\n\nIn our hectic, modern lives, many of us focus so heavily on work and family commitments that we never seem to have time for pure fun.

So much of our time is spent with poor posture with the shoulders hanging down and in front of the chest.  The video starts with a few stretches to open up the pecs/chest so that the chest.  then we do a few exercises to strengthen the muscles in the upper back that help to hold the shoulder in a heathy position and open the chest better.  Often Yoga classes emphasize \"heart openers\" but don''t emphasize the proper work needed to strengthen the postural muscles so that we can train the body to hold this posture more frequently.  When these muscles are properly strengthened it will teach you how to keep the chest more open in all of the postures and most importantly make us more efficient breathers/ blood pumpers. Or energetically speaking, increase our ability to process prana.  Who wouldn''t like a little more life force energy out of their practice?

Draw up through the lower abdominals (gently pull the belly button towards the spine).\n\nPlank/front support: Shoulders above the wrists, the tail bone should be tucked under and glutes activates to switch on your core belt. Aim to draw the lower abdominals in. Don’t let the lower back sag. This is a foundation for the other movements too-never let the bag sag!\n\nPush ups: Elbows graze the sides of the body, and aim to maintain the line of the body from the shoulders to the hips: You wan’t to move in one piece. If you feel the lower back sagging, drop your knees to the ground for extra support and re set your form.\n\nSide plank: the aim is to lift the hips to make a long line from shoulder to foot. Use both feet if you need, or a flat foot for extra support,. When you get stronger you can stack the feet or float the leg, without letting the hips drop.\n\nFloor exercises: Keep the lower back pressed into the floor. This engages the core belt front to back. You shouldn’t be able to fit your fingers underneath. If you notice this, stop and reset yourself. You don''t have to extend your heels towards the floor, if 45 degrees gets you working to begin with, stick with this til you get stronger. \n\nStar raises: Try not to let the shoulders touch the floor when you lower, draw up through the abdominals as you come up to your sit bones and twist, and don’t let your lower back arch as you try to maintain balance. \n\nSupermen: Keep the hips low and level with the shoulders but don’t let the back sag! Really reach out through the fingertips and the toes as you lift, this develops spinal stability. If you are finding this really challenging, only raise the hand/foot a few inches off the ground whilst still stretching out through the fingers/toes until you find your stability and strength improving.\n\nMountain climbers: Keep the hips low, the tailbone tucked, don’t let the lower back arch, especially if you''re getting tired!\n\nRead the full article for Arch Climbing Wall here at http://www.archclimbingwall.com/journal/climbflow-movement-series-1\n\nYou are ultimately responsible for yourself and any movement you engage in.

Although we would always suggest that you find a certified Iyengar yoga teacher so that you can attend a class near you, this channel has yoga sequences to help you practice your yoga at home.\n\nYoga is not a sport but regular practice of yoga sequences can improve fitness levels. Practiced correctly, yoga will stretch muscles and strengthen joints, as well as helping with mental and physical wellbeing; indeed many studies have shown that yoga can have remarkable effects on problems with back pain, shoulder pain and neck pain as well as demonstrating positive effects on mental health problems such as depression, stress and general anxiety. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/28/body-on-yoga_n_4109595.html?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004\n\nSubscribe to our channel; if you opt for notifications, you will be advised as new videos are launched. \n\n\nStay connected~\n\nFor more structured online yoga classes, visit My Yoga Tutor: http://myyogatutor.com/\n\nFor booking face to face Iyengar Yoga classes, with us at the Maidstone Yoga Centre in Kent, (first class free!): http://www.iyengar-yoga.co.uk/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MaidstoneYogaCentre/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MaidstoneYoga\n\nFor our ebook, \"Yoga for the Stiffer Body\": https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yoga-Stiffer-Body-Inspirational-Accessible-ebook/dp/B01IYO67M8\n\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/craddock1310\n\nFor Iyengar yoga classes in the UK: https://iyengaryoga.org.uk/\n\n \nA yoga practice may give you a physical workout, but more importantly, all our programmes are designed to harmonise mind, body and breath. Yoga is not just to increase your flexibility, strength and the general tone of your body; it has the capacity to free your mind, improve your wellbeing and increase your mental resilience. Begin here to create a foundation for a home yoga practice. These free online yoga classes can be practiced at home; although we would always suggest you find a qualified Iyengar Yoga teacher near to you so you can attend a class.\n\n We will be posting videos for all levels but if you have never done yoga before or you want to re-visit some of the basics - then start with our Beginners series!

A morning yoga stretch you can do right in bed! Bed yoga is not only convenient but also motivating on those days where you find it hard to hop out in the early mornings. Getting a good yoga stretch in before jumping out of bed helps to wake up the body and set the tone for an energetic day ahead. Although this practice is called bed yoga, you may also hop on your mat as i did! This 10 minute morning yoga is perfect for beginners and anyone looking for a gentle yoga practice. This yoga class is also great for relieving stress and anxiety.\n\nIt is also the last day, Day 5! of the 5 day morning yoga series and if you made it this far give your self a pat on the back, a big hug. and if you only made it a few days that is still awesome! With busy schedules it is really difficult to find the time to fit in a yoga practice especially in the mornings where we are rushing. Any chance you get to hop on your mat is a step towards growth. Do your best and you will reap the reward.\n\nGratitude to this series sponsor Liforme. Liforme is my absolute favorite yoga mat not only because its so deliciously sticky, but the passion behind the brand is something that aligns with who i am as a person.

A morning yoga stretch you can do right in bed! Bed yoga is not only convenient but also motivating on those days where you find it hard to hop out in the early mornings. Getting a good yoga stretch in before jumping out of bed helps to wake up the body and set the tone for an energetic day ahead. Although this practice is called bed yoga, you may also hop on your mat as i did! This 10 minute morning yoga is perfect for beginners and anyone looking for a gentle yoga practice. This yoga class is also great for relieving stress and anxiety.\n\nIt is also the last day, Day 5! of the 5 day morning yoga series and if you made it this far give your self a pat on the back, a big hug. and if you only made it a few days that is still awesome! With busy schedules it is really difficult to find the time to fit in a yoga practice especially in the mornings where we are rushing. Any chance you get to hop on your mat is a step towards growth. Do your best and you will reap the reward.\n\nGratitude to this series sponsor Liforme. Liforme is my absolute favorite yoga mat not only because its so deliciously sticky, but the passion behind the brand is something that aligns with who i am as a person.

This sequence can be used as a preparation into the splits. You will need a blanket (or two), two blocks, and a strap.\n\n-----\n\nHi everyone. This is Sam from Healthy Hints, and, today, I will be bringing you a sequence for flexibility. This sequence will be focusing on lengthening and opening up the hamstrings and hip flexors to help you get into a split comfortably. Grab a blanket, 2 blocks, a strap, and get on your mat. Let’s get started. \n\nStart with a strap and lay down on your back. Bring the right leg up and place the strap around the ball of the foot. Straighten the leg to, it doesn’t have to be 90 degrees, but to where your hamstring is comfortable. Flex your left foot. Press up into the strap to help lengthen those hamstrings. Switch sides. Place your left foot in the strap. Right leg goes nice and long. Press the ball of the foot up into that strap. Again, your leg does not have to be straight 90 degrees. Go as far as your hamstring will let you, but don’t pass 90 degrees, toward your face. \n\nBend the knee and come on up. You can get rid of the strap now. And come on over onto hands and knees and do a tabletop position. Hands are underneath the shoulders, knees underneath the hips. Lift the hips up and back, downward facing dog. Draw your stomach in. Get comfortable. Then, lift your right leg up. Bring it to the outside of your hands into a lizard lunge. Press those hips forward. If you want, you can bring your hands down and rest on your forearms. You’ll feel that stretch in the outer hip, as well as the hip flexor on the back leg. You are also welcome to lower the back knee to intensify the stretch. Walk your hands back up and straighten your leg this time. Hands on either side of the leg. Flex the foot. Bring your head down if you can. If this is too far for you, you can bring blocks underneath your hands. We’re just doing half splits to get the hamstrings to loosen up. Hinge forward. Slide that right foot back into downward facing dog, again. \n\nThen, bring the left leg up. Bring it to the outside of the hands, a lizard lunge on this side. And you can always bring your elbows down, or you can use blocks, depending on how tight you are. And you can lower the back knee down. Sink into those hips. This lizard pose will help you in the splits, help you lengthen out the inner thighs and the hip flexors. Hinge back. Straighten that leg. Flex the toes. Curl the toes back toward your face, and forward fold over your leg. Hinge forward again. Bring that left foot back into downward facing dog. Stretch out those hamstrings.\n\nLift that right leg up, and, then, bring it in between the hands this time. Keep that back leg nice and strong. Bring your right hand to the knee, then the left hand. If you want, you can lift the left arm up, and then the right arm up. Arch back, lifting your chest, crescent pose. If your balance is shaky, you are more than welcome to keep your hands down at the knee. Back into downward facing dog.\n\nLift the left leg up. Bring it forward in between the hands. Then, bring the left hand to the knee, right hand to the knee, and, if you want, right and left arm can go up, all depending on your balance. Keep that back leg nice and strong, so you’re stretching out that hip flexor and arching up and back. Hinge forward. Slide the left foot back, downward facing dog. \n\nWalk, step, or jump to standing, and then grab both of your blocks. Have your feet be hip width distance apart, as well as your blocks in front of your toes. Hinge at your hips and bring your hands right underneath your shoulders at the blocks at any level. Shift your weight into your toes so it feels like you’re falling forward, really lifting the tailbone up. Bring the blocks to any level that is comfortable to you. And, then, slowly come all the way up to standing. \n\nGrab just one block, now, and turn longways on your mat, taking a nice wide stance. Turn your left toes in, right toes out. Right arm reaches up above as you hinge forward on those hips. Legs stay straight. We’re going to triangle pose, lifting that left arm up. You can lower the block down to whatever level is comfortable to you. Make sure your legs are straight and your sides are long. Coming back up, we’ll switch sides, right toes in, left toes out. Block is in the left hand now as you reach up and forward fold over those legs. Hand comes underneath the shoulder. Right arm comes all the way up to the sky.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W7_fvtOSuFE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W7_fvtOSuFE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W7_fvtOSuFE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W7_fvtOSuFE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W7_fvtOSuFE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Healthy Hints","tags":["yoga for flexibility","flexibility","yoga","healthy hints yoga","healthy hints"],"categoryId":"26","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Super Simple 15 Minute Yoga for Flexibility","description":"This yoga video is for flexibility, most specifically the hamstrings and hip flexors.
